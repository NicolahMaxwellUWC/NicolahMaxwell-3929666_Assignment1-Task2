# EncryptDecrypt

The EncryptDecrypt application is an Android specific app that allows a user to enter a Ciphertext that was encrypted using the Monoalphabetic Substitution method and decrypts it into English Plaintext, and vice versa.

## EncryptDecrypt Description

1. What this Application Does
: EncrypDecrypt was built using the [MIT App Inventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu/) platform. It provides its users with 2 functionality options, the option to encrypt a plaintext extract, and the option to decrypt a ciphertext extract. The method of encryption that this application uses is the *Monoalphabetic Substitution Method* which uses the 26 letters in the English alphabet, and substitutes it with a letter other than itself. 
- The following shows the respective substitutions used to encrypt plaintext and decrypt ciphertext
**A	B	C	D	E	F	G	H	I	J	K	L	M N	O	P	Q	R	S	T	U	V	W	X	Y	Z**
  B	K	F	L	M	N	O	P	H	Q	R	S	A C	T	I	U	G	E	_	D	V	W	X	Y	_
*T* and *Z* did not appear in the cipher text at all and therefore, no exact substitution could be made for these 2 letters.

2. Why I used MIT App Inventor
: I began the process of building the application using Android Studio, which is considered to be one of the best platforms to build Android specific application, which was one of the requirements for this assignment. However, using Android Studio requires extreme coding, which made the process more complex than it needed to be. Once I discovered that *MIT ai* could produce an equally efficient application in a much less complex and no-code way, I decided to try this platform instead. It provides its users with a drag-and-drop method of developing apps, which allows for a more convenient way of monitoring you app's interface as well the way in which the app will work.

3. Challenges Faced Throughout this Assignment
: The biggest challenge that I faced, other than struggling with developing the app from scratch through coding, was being able to extract text from an image in order to analyse the text. Because I switched the platforms that I was using so late in the assignment, I unfortunately did not have time to overcome this challenge by the assigned due date.


## How to Install and Use EncryptDecrypt

1. Step 1:
Visit the Respository in [GitHub](https://github.com/NicolahMaxwellUWC/NicolahMaxwell-3929666_Assignment1-Task2). Here you will find a host of files including the EncryptDecrypt APK, the text files containing the ciphertext and plaintext examples, as well as a How-To video demonstrating the process of installation and ustilisation of this application.

2. Step 2:
Open the APK file, and select *View Raw*. This will download the APK file and automatically store it onto your device.

3. Step 3:
If you wish to use this application on any device other than an Android, you will need to download an Android emulator such as [Memu](https://www.memuplay.com/), which this app has already been tested on. 
Emulator
: Open up the emulator, import the APK file from your downloads, and installation should begin automatically.

Android Device
: Open the downloaded file, and installation should begin automatically.

4. Step 4:
Now, whether or not you are using an Android device, the application should work the same once it has been installed on your device/emulator.
When you open the application, you may be presented with either the *Encrypt/Decrypt* page, click on the *Back* button to be redirected to the *Home Page*. Select either the the *Encrypt/Decrypt* button to proceed to encode/decode your text passage.

5. Step 5:
Whichever option you choose, a text box will appear providing you with the opportunity to type in your text passage, and it will produce the opposite. *i.e. plaintext -> ciphertext and/or ciphertext -> plaintext*

### Side note
As you can see, there is an option to "Take a Picture", which would have been utilised in order to take a picture using the camera and extract the text to be analysed. The app goes as far as capturing the image, but it unable to extract the text.
