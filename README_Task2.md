1. IDENTIFY ANY SINGLE LETTER WORDS:
Considering the fact that the cipher text only includes letters in the english language, we can assume that a substitution method was utilised. In this case, only the letter *M* is a single letter word. In the english language, there are only 2 letters, being *A* and/or *I* that can be used as single letter words.

2. EXPANDING ON THE SINGLE LETTER:
I then identified any other short words in the cipher text that included the letter *M* to try and identify which one would be more suitable accordingly. I decided to begin deciphering if the *M* = *A* and came up with the following results:
- M = A
- MO = AT / AS / AN
- MF = AT / AS / **AN**
- MFU = **AND** / ARE
- MDD = ADD / **ALL**
- NMDD = CALL / FALL / HALL / MALL

3. IDENTIFY POPULAR SHORT WORDS / INDIVIDUAL LETTERS:
Once I decided which possibilities I was going to investigate further, I started looking for more popular letters within words specifically that I could possibly decipher. The letter *G* seemed to be a good one to go with. Because it is prominent on so many places, I tried to associate it to a vowel. 
If *G* = *O*:
- OG = TO, SO
- GC = OF, ON, OK, OR
- GK = OF, ON, OK, OR
- LG = TO, SO
- GF = OF, **ON**, OK, OR
- GFS = ONE
- CGK = 
- CGKE = 

4. BEGIN SUBSTITUTING LETTERS IN THE CIPHER TEXT:
At this point, I began filling in some of the letters in the cipher text that I idenified in plainext by means of frequency analysis as follows:
ONE _A_ TO _OL_E AN EN____TE_ _E__A_E, __ __ _NO_ _T_ LAN__A_E, __ TO __ND A ____E_ENT _LA_NTE_T O_ 

5. TACKLE THE BIGGER WORDS:
I then went further to try and use the identified letters to fill in some of the bigger words in the text and see which of them sounded most likely to be correct:
ONE _A_ TO _OL_E AN EN____TED _E__A_E, IF _E _NO_ IT_ LAN__A_E, I_ TO FIND A DIFFE_ENT _LAINTE_T

6. MORE RECOGNISABLE:
At this point, more words started looking recognisable and more letters could then be identified and continued to complete the process:
ONE _A_ TO SOL_E AN EN_R_PTED _ESSA_E, IF _E _NO_ ITS LAN__A_E, IS TO FIND A DIFFERENT PLAINTEXT

ONE WAY TO SOLVE AN ENCRYPTED _ESSA_E, IF _E _NO_ ITS LAN__A_E, IS TO FIND A DIFFERENT PLAINTEXT

ONE WAY TO SOLVE AN ENCRYPTED MESSAGE, IF WE KNOW ITS LANGUAGE, IS TO FIND A DIFFERENT PLAINTEXT OF THE SAME LANGUAGE LONG ENOUGH TO FILL ONE SHEET OR SO, AND THEN WE COUNT THE OCCURRENCES OF EACH LETTER. WE CALL THE MOST FRE_UENTLY

ONE WAY TO SOLVE AN ENCRYPTED MESSAGE, IF WE KNOW ITS LANGUAGE, IS TO FIND A DIFFERENT PLAINTEXT OF THE SAME LANGUAGE LONG ENOUGH TO FILL ONE SHEET OR SO, AND THEN WE COUNT THE OCCURRENCES OF EACH LETTER. WE CALL THE MOST FREQUENTLY OCCURRING LETTER THE 'FIRST', THE NEXT MOST OCCURRING LETTER THE 'SECOND', THE FOLLOWING MOST OCCURRING LETTER THE 'THIRD', AND SO ON, UNTIL WE ACCOUNT FOR ALL THE DIFFERENT NUMBERS IN THE PLAINTEXT SAMPLE. THEN WE LOOK AT THE CIPHER TEXT WE WANT TO SOLVE AND WE ALSO CLASSIFY ITS SYM_OLS.

7. THE FINAL PLAINTEXT:
Once I have the first 3 sentences complete, it was more just a substitution process using the letters that I already had identified. I thought that this process would be fairly quick, but I was mistaken. It still took quite some time to finish off the entire substitution process for the cipher text paragaph.

## The Substitutions - Monoalphabetic Substitution
**A	B	C	D	E	F	G	H	I	J	K	L	M N	O	P	Q	R	S	T	U	V	W	X	Y	Z**
  B	K	F	L	M	N	O	P	H	Q	R	S	A C	T	I	U	G	E	_	D	V	W	X	Y	_
*T* and *Z* did not appear in the cipher text at all and therefore, no exact substitution could be made for these 2 letters.
